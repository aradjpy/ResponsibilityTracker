# ResponsibilityTracker
This is a simple "punch in punch out" app where you can track how long you've been working, what you've been working on, on what date, and your most productive days.
This is subject to change and will at one point include ML to categorise what was actually more productive based off of your priorites.The entirety of this project was coded authentically, without the use of AI. While this is a kind of basic project, it—along with the ones that will follow—serves a larger purpose: rebuilding critical thinking skills rather than relying on having all the answers immediately available.

Each follow encourages me to dive deeper, uncover more interesting insights from different kinds of data, and contribute to a more educated and thoughtful world.

Some upcoming projects may involve Machine Learning or even Computer Vision, but the goal remains the same: completing everything without a single line of code written by AI. (Note: this text was grammatically refined by AI, so this is not meant as criticism or a promotion against using AI.)
